# Micrograd-bend

This is the implementation of Karapathy's [micrograd]() in the Bend programming language. 
Since the language is implemented and does not have all the features yet, I have made sure to implement the micrograd using existing features
and clever manipulation of the fun syntax. This may lead to a sub optimized version but can't wait to test and benchmark this after it gets completed. 

# Requirements
- Install Bend
- Try and read the dreaded docs !!! (Still would like to appreciate maintainers of HOC/Bend for them)

# How to Use 
```
bend run micrograd.bend
```
## What works
- Able to define a Node in the NN graph
- Some operations
- Gradient calculations are not working yet !!! (hard with functional programming)
